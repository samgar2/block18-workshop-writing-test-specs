Unit Tests
1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

    - Expect multiplication(2, 5) to be a number
    - Expect multiplication(2, 5) to multiply the two inputted numbers together
    - Expect multiplication("a", 5) to be an error
    - Expect multiplication(2, 5) to be 10
    - Expect multiplacaton(2, 5) to be an error
    - Expect multiplication(25) to be an error

2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

    - Expect concatOdds([1, 2, 3], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) to result in [1, 3, 5]
    - Expect multiples of the same odd number in the concatOdds arrays to show up only once in the output
    - Expect concatOdds to return a single array with numbers 
    - Expect concatOdds([1, 2, 3], ["a", 4, 3, 2, 1]) to return an error
    - Expect concatOdds to return only the odd numbers from both of the arrays
    - Expect concatOdds to return the numbers in ascending order
    - Expect concatOdds([1, 2, 3]) to return an error

Functional Tests
1. A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.

    - When a user tries to checkout with an emtpy cart, the following browser message should pop up encouraging them to continue shopping: "Continue Shopping To Check Out!"
    - When a user goes to checkout, they should be prompted to log in if they have an account, to create a new account if they don't have one yet, or to check out as a guest with these 2 messages: "Log in with your account or create a new one!" and in a smaller size at the bottom of the screen it should read: "Or continue as a guest"
    - When a user tries to login without an account, they should be shown an error message: "No Account Found" and directed to a new browser page to create an account
    - When a user inputs the wrong username or password, they should be shown an error message with the options to click on the "Forgot Username?" and "Forgot Password?" links to reset them
    - When a user logs in with their correct account info, they should be directed to the payment checkout page
    - When a user tries to create an account with an invalid email, they should be shown an error message: "Invalid Email Address"
    - When a user chooses to checkout as a guest, they should be immediately directed to the payment checkout page
    - When a user chooses to create a new account, a couple of boxes should pop up on the screen asking them to input their first and last name, email address, birthday, username, and password, and after inputting that info they should be directed to the payment checkout page
    - When a user successfully logs in, creates an account, or checks out as a guest, they should be directed to the payment page and asked to: "Choose Your Payment Method"
    - After the user successfully inputs their payment info, they should be asked to choose their shipping from these 2 options: "Free Standard Shipping (4-7 days), $15 Expedited Shipping (1-2 days)"
    - After the user successfully chooses their shipping option, their total price should asjust accordingly (either stay the same with the free standard shipping or incree by $15 with the expedited shipping)
    - After the total price has been reflected, the user should be asked to "Place Order" with a big button at the bottom of the screen
    - When the user successfully places their order, they should be taken to a new browser page that displays a big "Thank You For Your Purchase!" message at the top and shows their order number, price, product purchased, and expected delivery date details 
    - When the user leaves the checkout process before finishing/actually purchasing their product, they should get a broswer pop up message that asks them: "Leaving this page will lose your progress- do you want to continue?"
